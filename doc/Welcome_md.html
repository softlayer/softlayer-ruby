<p>The <code>softlyer_api</code> Ruby Gem provides a convenient way to call
into the <a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> API from the Ruby
programming language. This is accomplished using the XML-RPC interface
provided by <a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> and the <a
href="XMLRPC.html">XMLRPC</a> client built into the core Ruby language.</p>

<p>For more information about the <a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> API,
and the routines and data structures it offers should visit the <a
href="http://sldn.softlayer.com">SoftLayer Developer Network (SLDN)
website</a>.</p>

<p>This document is written for Ruby developers who wish to interact with
their <a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> accounts through Ruby scripts.
<a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> also offers a command line tool for
performing common tasks. If prefer to use that tool, we invite you to look
into the <a
href="https://softlayer-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cli.html">command
line interface</a> that is part of the <a
href="http://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python">git</a> project.</p>

<p>This documentation is also written for Ruby developers who wish to
contribute to the <code>softlayer_api</code> Gem. The Gem is a work in
progress. We welcome the support of the <a
href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> development community to improve the
Gem. The project is open source and we hope that source will serve as a
useful library, stand as sample code to assist exploration, and serve as an
opportunity for developers to shape it for both those needs.</p>

<p>The primary repository for the Gem’s source code is the <a
href="http://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-ruby">softlayer-ruby</a> github
project.</p>

<h1 id="label-Overview">Overview<span><a href="#label-Overview">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>These Ruby language bindings allow access to the <a
href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> API on two different levels. A <a
href="Foundation_md.html">Foundation</a> layer for low-level interaction
with the <a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> API, and an abstraction
layer that simplifies and isolates scripts from some of the details found
in the <a href="Foundation_md.html">Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Foundation_md.html">Foundation</a> layer, makes use of the <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/xmlrpc/rdoc/XMLRPC/Client.html">XMLRPC
client</a> which is part of the Core library of Ruby itself. This
foundation is embodied primarily in the <code>SoftLayer::Client</code> and
<code>SoftLayer::Service</code> classes. Requests are made, and responses
retrieved using fundamental Ruby types such as Hashes, Arrays, Strings, and
Integers.</p>

<p>The Model layer is built atop the foundation as object class hierarchy. The
class hierarchy models the structures found in the <a
href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> environment using the object-oriented
features of Ruby. It does this to abstract out some of the implementation
detail that a developer would commonly have to work with to communicate
with <a href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> through the foundation layer.</p>

<p>The Model layer is by no means complete; quite to the contrary it is in its
infancy and we believe that much of the development effort in the Gem will
focus on incorporating new models into this layer. Because it is
incomplete, however, we have put some effort into bridges from the
functionality of the model, down to the lower level foundation, without
trouble. Also, as a result of this, developers interested in using the
Model layer should also should familiarize themselves with the <a
href="Foundation_md.html">Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>All developers should continue their exploration of the
<code>softlayer_api</code> gem by examining the <a
href="Foundation_md.html">Foundation</a> documentation. Clients that wish
to make use of the abstractions provided in the object hierarchy may
continue their exploration by looking at the Model Layer documentation.
Developers who wish to expand the models found in the
<code>softlayer_api</code> Gem should read the <a
href="ContributionGuide_md.html">Contribution Guide</a></p>
